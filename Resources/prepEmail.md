With just a month to go before you start learning we just want to make sure you are all prepped and ready when you come in after the new year.

You've already attended a evening to get your computer all up and running. If you haven't and even if you have please make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Browsers: Chrome (https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) and Firefox (https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
- Sublime Text Editor (https://www.sublimetext.com/) if you are comfortable with another code editor this is also fine.
- Slack (https://slack.com/download) all resources, links, discussions and communications happen through Slack, so it's really really important you have it up and running at all times. We recommend the desktop app

You will also need Photoshop and Balsamiq (wire framing software). Please note these trials only last a matter of days so installing them closer to the time is advised if you are not looking to purchase

- Photoshop - we will be covering this in the first week http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop.html
- Balsamic - we will be covering this in the second week https://balsamiq.com/

You're learning to be a developer! Awesome! As developers we use the command line a *lot*. Codeacdemy's Learn the Command Line https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line is a great introduction to get you more familiar with running commands within the environment. It's essential you work through this before the course starts.

It's also essential you are familier with your own computer. Knowing your file system is extremely important. This article explains everything particularly well http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/working-with-files-and-folders

It's also great that you know how to cast from Chrome browser https://support.google.com/chromecast/answer/3228332?hl=en-GB (read 'Casting your laptop/desktop content')

In the first two weeks you'll learn how to write HTML and CSS at a professional level. To make sure you are prepared for this reading Jon Duckett's HTML and CSS https://www.amazon.co.uk/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1512565124&sr=8-1&keywords=html+and+css gives you a great starting foundation to build on.
