## Aside: Performance

---

### Data

Network: Modems, 2G, 3G, 4G, Broadband, Cable

Everything that makes an app or website is made of data, that data needs to be served over the network

Thus it needs to be downloaded

---

### But why tho?

- Users donâ€™t like waiting (2 secs max)
- Users have data plans |
- Users may not have good connections |

---

### So?

- Users == Money/Revenue
- Amazon reduce their load speed by 1ms - reduce revenue by 1% |

---

### How

Write good *concise* DRY code

Note: There are many many techniques to do with performance - you will learn a lot more of this over your career, but suffice to say start with good clean code
