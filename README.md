TALK: Ruth John: How to be a Web A/V Artist


Wk2 Day1 - Revise. Look at brief, get personas, think of features and functionality, sitemap, scamp, wireframe
  Use same example for all activities. When thinking of features and functionality go into a user journey (one for each user?) - then scamp those user journeys.
  Wireframe from that.
Maybe do a comparison https://www.getingofar.gov.uk/ look at research? I think this day can be thought out betterer - do we have the sales app wireframes to give them after the task? Show them how it’s done...
  Find a better way talk than Joes - or a better talk Joe has done.
Designs for appcare are wrong as far as order of form fields go…
Move frameworks, libraries apis slide...
  I think Harry’s talk would be better off on day two after sass and they’ve started on the selects.
  Do we need bootstrap - it’s fiddly, it’s not real wordly, could we style selects a different more modern way? Form validation with libraries - this is pretty js’y anyway...
