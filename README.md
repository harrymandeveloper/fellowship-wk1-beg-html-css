Welcome to DevelopMe_ Coding Fellowships first week. Here you will find all the class resources, presentations, lessons, exercises, talks and further reading from everything we cover within the first two weeks of the course.

This is a living breathing syllabus, which means it is changed and updated regularly to reflect the web industry.
