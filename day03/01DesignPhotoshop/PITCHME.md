## Design & Brief

### What to think about & ask

---

---

## What should you ask for?

---

### Design handover

- Artwork file |
- Responsive designs |
- Fonts |
- Other assets (images, icons) - can export from artwork yourself |
- Media (videos, audio) |
- Animations, interactivity (hovers) |

---

### What to expect

> Lots of designs

- Home |
- Standard page: About |
- Contact page |
- Article list page: news |
- Individual article page |

---

### Different program files

- Photoshop (PSD)

> Will have layers to turn on and off access different elements separately.

- InDesign (INDD)

>Vector files, layers, copy text, fonts. May include source images (links).

---

- Possibly Illustrator

>Also vector

- Sketch (not Adobe, mac only)

>Super good at website & app. Vector based.

---

### Flat (image) files ok...

- PDFs
	Good, vector-based, usually not lossy compression, often can copy text.
- PNGs
	Lossless.
- JPGs
	Lossy compression, difficult to get clean image from. Potentially different ‘colourspace’.

> We'll take about image formats later

---

## Photoshop

---

Let's open it and get it set up!

- Crop and re-size - e.g. 1200 width
- Check Image > Mode > “RGB” & “8 Bits/channel”
- Preference units
- Rulers

---

### RGB vs CMYK

Images can have different colour space

Print uses CMYK (4 colour process), but screens have RGB (3 colour pixels)

Use of CMYK images on web can display weirdly Design files can often be set to CMYK, so check!

---

### Open file & tools

- Layers |
- Eyedropper |
- Curve |
- Marquee |
- Create new image from part of design |

---

## Image types

---

### Raster (Bitmap)

- png
	Has transparency, good compression, can be big
- jpg
	No transparency but smaller than png
- tiff
	No place on the web really
- gif
	Transparency, animation, small file size, incredibly big file size

---

### Vector based

- svg

> Scalable (and actually code!)

- fonts
- Adobe Illustrator
- Figma [www.figma.com](www.figma.com) (and more...)

---

## Planning layout

---

### Create a blueprint

Sketch out and annotate, note dimensions, colours, repeated styles, fonts, naming for classes later.

Use:
- Paper & pen (a lot!)
- Whiteboard
- Photoshop
